# GeoIP lookup

This API allows IP lookups for geolocation data.

Note that this is intended as a programming test, and was not ever used in production - use at your own risk.

Credits go to [DB-IP](https://db-ip.com/) for the database

## Installation

Note that the commands bellow have been tested only using Docker for Mac 17.12
I expect errors with XDebug configuration if you're running on a different system.

```
make install
```

```
make start
```

Then head to [http://localhost:8081]()

## API Docs

Sorry, no OpenAPI doc yet, this will have to do ;)
